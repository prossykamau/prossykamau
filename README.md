A machine learning model to recommend movies based on user preferences and ratings. This project includes data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

### [Breast Cancer Detection Model](https://github.com/prossykamau/Breast-Cancer-Detection-Model)
The Breast Cancer Detection Model is an advanced machine learning model designed to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Leveraging the power of predictive analytics and image processing techniques, this model analyzes mammogram images or relevant clinical data to identify patterns that may indicate the presence of malignant tumors.
The Breast Cancer Detection Model is an advanced machine learning model designed to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Leveraging the power of predictive analytics and image processing techniques, this model analyzes mammogram images or relevant clinical data to identify patterns that may indicate the presence of malignant tumors.

Key features of the Breast Cancer Detection Model:

    Data Input: Processes mammogram images or structured clinical data (such as biopsy results and genetic markers) to ensure versatility across different diagnostic workflows.

    Image Analysis: Utilizes computer vision algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect abnormalities within the images that may indicate cancerous growths.

    Predictive Accuracy: Trained on extensive datasets to ensure high accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors, reducing false positives and enhancing early detection capabilities.

    User-Friendly Interface: Aimed at healthcare professionals, providing intuitive insights and diagnostics that can be easily integrated into existing medical workflows.

    Continuous Learning: Improves over time with access to more data, making the model more robust and adaptive to emerging patterns in breast cancer diagnoses.

### [Real Estate Data Analysis](https://github.com/prossykamau/Real-Estate-Data-Analysis-Project)
The Real Estate Data Analysis Model is a powerful analytical tool designed to evaluate and predict real estate market trends. Leveraging machine learning and statistical modeling, this model processes vast datasetsâ€”such as property prices, location data, demographics, and economic indicatorsâ€”to provide insights into property valuations, demand forecasting, and investment potential.

Key features:

    Market Trend Analysis: Identifies and tracks trends in property values, rental yields, and market growth.

    Price Prediction: Uses historical data and predictive algorithms to estimate future property prices, helping investors and buyers make informed decisions.

    Comparative Market Analysis: Provides real-time data on comparable properties, offering competitive insights for buyers, sellers, and agents.

    Investment Scoring: Evaluates properties based on key metrics, assisting investors in identifying high-potential opportunities.

### [Stroke Prediction Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/prossykamau/Stroke_Prediction_ML_Model)
The Stroke Prediction Machine Learning Model is an advanced predictive tool designed to assess an individual's risk of experiencing a stroke. Using machine learning algorithms and clinical data, this model identifies risk factors and patterns that may indicate a higher likelihood of stroke, supporting early intervention and preventive healthcare measures.

Key features:

    Risk Assessment: Analyzes patient data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, lifestyle factors, and medical history to estimate stroke risk.

    Predictive Accuracy: Trained on diverse, large-scale healthcare datasets to ensure high precision in identifying individuals at elevated risk, improving preventative care.

    Early Intervention Alerts: Provides risk scores and flags patients with high stroke probability, allowing healthcare providers to prioritize and personalize care.

    Explainable AI: Uses interpretable machine learning techniques to explain the key risk factors, supporting doctors in communicating insights to patients.
### [FarmDtect WebApp](https://github.com/Abuz254/Farm_Dtect)
The Data-Driven Crop Diagnostic Platform is an innovative AI-powered solution designed to help rural farmers diagnose crop diseases and optimize agricultural practices. By leveraging advanced image classification technology and integrating environmental data, this platform provides actionable insights and recommendations to enhance crop health and productivity.
